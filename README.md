Living in the information era and being bombarded in a day to day basis by all different kinds of mediums, advertisers had embraced an adversarial role in society where users of different platforms are encouraged to upgrade their subscriptions in order to avoid advertisement. Such is the case of big platforms like Spotify and Youtube. Thus the effects of un-targeted advertising may even be detrimental for a brand in terms of its public image, it running the risk of being labeled as intrusive and annoying. This among many other factors has created an increasing value on personal data which, in the past, users were eager to give away in order to connect with their friends and family, giving an increasing power to social networks. This resulted in the user losing power over their data which is now being centralized by social networks who become the owners and the ones selecting whom to share it with. The present paper presents a system where users are able to own their data while allowing advertisers to reach their desired audience in a cooperative way without the need for a middleman.
